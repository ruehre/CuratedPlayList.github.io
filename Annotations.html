            Genre: Rap<br>
This is J Cole's newest song in response to the 2020 BLM movement. It talks about how people look up to him and how he along with other celebrities need to step up and be the voice that people need. J Cole is hands down top 3 of the best rappers of this era. He is lyrically a genius so for him to put out this song it just goes to show that he cares and that people will listen and respond to it.

In “Otherside of America”, Meek Mill powerfully shares his side of the story. The song is started off with a speech by the current President highlighting the difficulties that plague Black societies. Meek Mill then goes into a song, rapping about the community he comes from and the lengths he had to go to just to get by. His song highlights the struggles of certain Black communities and asks people to think before they judge those people’s actions. The song ends with Mill asking a reporter if he grew up in those conditions, wouldn’t he carry a gun too. The reporter responds, “yeah, I probably would”.

            Genre: Gospel<br>
Produced for the 2019 film “Harriet”, which depicts the life story of Harriet Tubman and her role in helping slaves escape to freedom through the Underground Railroad, this song highlights the strength it took to rebel against the terrible institution of slavery. Resistance is seen in the lyrics, calling for people to stand up and fight against oppression in order to create a better life for each other despite the costs. It includes some musical Africanisms, such as humming and clapping, which foster a sense of community and the power and freedom that comes with that.

As Black women are often one of the most excluded groups in society, this song shares an important message of self-acceptance. European beauty ideals are often dominant in the media, occasionally making others who do not fit that mold feel as if they do not qualify as beautiful. This song challenges those thoughts, calling for Black girls to recognize and embrace the beauty and power in themselves despite whatever the world may throw at them.

            Genre: Hip Hop / Rap<br>
Resisting against European standards of beauty, this song illustrates Black women taking charge of themselves and their sexuality. Through upbeat music, highlighting the word melanin, and comparing it to sweet things like chocolate, this song becomes an anthem for Black women to be proud of their skin color and own it. This song resists against a history of darker skin being seen as “ugly” or “undesirable” by recognizing it as beautiful and powerful. The inclusion of many artists in the creation of this song creates a sense of community, while also highlighting the fact that all are different and beautiful.

            Genre: Hip Hop / Rap<br>
Released during a time of political and social unrest, this song depicts the difficulty of Black life in America. With the juxtaposition of happy, upbeat choruses and the dark, aggressive verses, we get a glimpse of the harsh reality that may face. The music video is particularly important, with imagery alluding to that of Jim Crow, religious affect, and police violence. It was chosen not only due to its important and unique sound and imagery but also due to its popularity and significance to our current state in America.

            Genre: Alt<br>
A direct response to the epidemic of police violence and brutality, this song captures the pain expressed by so many against the people meant to protect us, echoing the final words of Eric Garner in the chorus, “I can’t breathe”, a simple sentence that haunts us all. The music video includes corrupt cops framing and terrorizing black men. It was chosen because it reminds us how normalized state violence against black bodies is, even though no one in particular was mentioned, they didn't have to be.

Written in response to the deadly shootings across the country, released in the wake of the infamous Parkland shooting, this song addresses the state of gun violence in America, and the bloody and corrupt politics and politicians behind it. It was chosen because of the harsh reality it accurately depicts, and the repetition of the pointless platitudes often muttered after a shooting.

            Year: 2017<br>
            Genre: Blues / Hip Hop<br>
Calling attention to the ongoing discrimination and oppression of Black individuals, this song is a powerful anthem for freedom. In his lyrics “All we wanna do is take these chains off | All we wanna do is break the chains of pain | All we wanna do is be free”, J. Cole clearly highlights the fact that the effects of slavery and Jim Crow segregation are still haunting many and making it difficult to live life freely and safely. Sometimes, for White and non-Black people of color it can be easy to fall into the trap of thinking so much progress has been made, that things are better now. Through his lyrics and music video, J. Cole’s song strongly resists that idea and calls for change to continue so they can finally “be free”.

The story of O J talks about black excellence and was one of the main protest songs in 2017 regarding BLM. He sings about the struggles of a black man and how when you get to that fame you need to pass it on to the younger black generations. I chose it for the stunning cartoonist work in the music video along with Jay-Z's ability to lyrically make you think when listening to his music.

            Year: 2017<br>

This song is used to resist heteronormative ideals. Brockhampton uses blatant lyrics to shed light on the harmful effects of homophobia, particularly within the music industry, while openly expressing personal affiliations with those affected by these issues. This song is significant because, as expressed in the song, heteronormative societal ideals can be very dangerous and even deadly for those who do not identify with this exclusive category as well as very persuasive for those that believe that individuals who deviate from this dominant category are deserving of unjust treatment.

This song was chosen by Ahmad Rashad Washington as part of an article on using hip hop to support in social justice counseling with Black males. The lyrics help individuals to find the words to describe their situation and how they feel. Some of the lyrics that stand out here are “I wonder is the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie | Watch me as the cops be tryin' to and pop and lock me | They cocky, plus they mentality is Nazi | The way they treat blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi”. Common talks about the experience of “real people” breaking down the image that everyone lives a happy life and that all figures of authority are doing their job correctly.

This song is used to resist racial oppression.

This song is significant because it helps to show that these issues have not been resolved but continue to prevail and harm the oppressed.

            Year: 2015<br>
            Genre: Hip Hop / Rap<br>
In this song, Sa-Roc dreams of a better future while highlighting the ongoing injustices faced by the black population. Her lyrics such as “Jim Crow just gentrified and they retrofit hangings” illustrate how oppression and segregation have not been extinguished, they have just evolved. Her song is a clear protest against the system and calls out the actions of police targeting individuals based on skin color and media for false or mis-representation of information.

            Genre: Hip Hop / Soul<br>
From the 2014 film "Selma", based on the Selma to Montgomery voting rights march in 1965, this song is powerful in calling for social change. Through his lyrics, artist Common recounts the actions of Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and other prominent figures of the civil rights movement. Artist John Legend references the endless struggle against racial discrimination and oppression, reminding the listeners that the fight against it is not yet over but that freedom and glory will come.

            Genre: Hip Hop / Rap<br>
Exposing the government-funded violence to poor communities of color, this song spares none in its harsh (and legit) criticisms of Reaganomics and other racial injustices in America. War, surveillnce, drugs, police brutality, and the legacy of slavery are all touched on in this song. The backdrop of Reagan’s voice in various speeches in the song is uncomfortable. It was chosen also due to its use in the Netflix documentary on our criminal justice system, 13th.

            Genre: Hip Hop / Rap<br>
This song is used to resist heteronormative ideals. By expressing concerns about the harmful effects of heteronormativity for anyone who does not identify with this category, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis attempt to enlighten those who are ignorant of the fact that sexual orientation is not a choice nor something that can be changed. This song is significant because heteronormative ideals are extremely dangerous because they continuously harm individual self-worth by perpetuating the myth that anything that deviates from these societal standards is unacceptable. These standards affect the way individuals feel about themselves and the way they treat others.

Based in the time of the French revolution, this song stands to provide context for how the people came together to overthrow the French royalty. The song has an overarching theme or unity and togetherness that is still relevant today in times of unrest and protests.

The Song talks about resisting conformity to the majority. The song provokes the question: What would be different if society didn’t try to standardize everything? The song is presented as a dream in which the black individual was accepted, but that dream fades as the individual wakes up in reality.

This song resists the idea that Black individuals can’t achieve greatness and success. Considering this was the year Obama got elected, this song destroys this idea. Furthermore the repetition  of the lyric “We ain’t ready to have a black president” highlights racist attitudes that exist.

This song addresses the social issues of disadvantaged communities. The lyrics call attention to problems such as drugs and violence that exist as a result of a lack of support. The song essentially lists a multitude of issues present in America that disproportionately affect underserved communities, the part of “America” that a lot of people don’t want to acknowledge.

The song “American Gangster” by Jay-Z was inspired by the movie “American Gangster” which depicts a rags to riches story of a black man who spent his early life as a drug dealer and how he escaped that life. This song confronts the disadvantages and stereotypes that most African Americans face but how it's still possible to chase your dreams.

This song stands to make comments about America’s war with Iraq. The song is written from the focus of the children who are innocent, yet “need guns” to protect themselves in the time of war. Written in protest for the children, Dirty Harry stands to reiterate that war is not the answer and in fact causes more destruction than it does good. The band sings “they ain’t got a chance” - a heavy lyric about the children and the poor people of Iraq, while set to an upbeat musical score that is rather antithetical to the lyrics.

The song “Where Is The Love?” is a comment on the racial injustice, war, discrimination, and corruption plaguing society. It seems to ask why, why must the world be filled with all this pain and suffering. It strongly implies that if we are able to overcome these things, then we will be able to build a better society. This song asks people to go against the grain, to choose to open their hearts and find love in themselves and others. It calls for acceptance and empathy, so that the world can be a better place for the children of the future.

The presence of spoken real statistics about incarceration in America against the heavy rock sound in this song is unsettling, but intriguing.

This album was one of the last to be released during the Black Arts Movement. It was a heavily criticized album as some argued it promoted violence. Nonetheless, it still managed to become a hit. Perhaps, the perceived “promotion of violence” was mistaken for an individual’s circumstance or experience, and thus one can draw a different meaning from the album.

This song, as stated by writer Gail Hilson Woldu is used to resist harmful European standards of beauty, specifically concerning body type standards. Sir-Mix-A-Lot uses this song to resist harmful European standards of beauty by celebrating and glorifying African American aspects of beauty that are seen as undesirable according to European standards. This song is significant because cultural beauty standards directly affect self-image and have the potential to be very harmful if anyone feels that they don't fit these unrealistic standards.

This song was written around the subject of racism and unequal rights. Even the name of the band - Public Enemy - was a statement of how being black made you a public enemy in the eyes of society.It took until 1989's "Fight the Power" for Public Enemy to create a single unified message that a lot of people—not just African Americans—could get behind. "Fight the Power" left much of the Black militancy on the table and concentrated on getting listeners to participate in politics.

Calling out the misrepresentation of Black individuals, this song seeks to bring light to and take down the stereotypes and prejudices that surround Black individuals. The lyric “The minute they see me, fear me | I’m the epitome, a public enemy”, describes how many people choose to judge an individual based on appearance before they get to know them. Public Enemy calls their listeners to not “believe the hype”, meaning to resist believing the false information spread by the media and society.

This song speaks to a man’s desire to be free to express himself and his sexuality. Author Mark Anthony Neal writes that the song ‘Free Man’ was “acknowledged as an anthem of Black male homosexuality in the 1970s”. During this time period, many artists began including topics of sexuality and homosexuality in their work as well as experimenting with new forms of self-expression.

This song, as stated by writer Mark Anthony Neal was used to resist sexual repression, specifically African American sexual repression, during the post-civil rights time period. By using this song to express sexual freedom, Labelle uses music as a means to resist sexual repression. This song is significant because, as explained by Mark Anthony Neal, it was written during a time when sexual freedom was used as an excuse to condone acts of sexual violence towards African American women through the spreading and entertainment of the myth that African American women were “insatiable”.

            Genre: Folk / Polk<br>
This song, unlike Simone’s of the same name, speaks of revolution as something that must come as a result of patience and peace. The song stands to say that change doesn’t come from violence or unrest but rather is birthed slowly from a collective will for a new society. The song also speaks about people’s minds as if they are closed off and unwilling to accept change to which kinds of people, this song is a lesson.

            Year: 1958<br>
            Genre: Spiritual<br>
This song was a popular spiritual. African spirituals were commonly known to have double meanings and be used as emotional outlets and tools to communicate. By using music to communicate with each other, enslaved people were able to subvert and resist the people and institutions trying to control them. ‘Go Down Moses’ is especially significant as it was used to help slaves escape to freedom, specifically by Harriet Tubman.
